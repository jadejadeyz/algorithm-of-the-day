In this repo, I will update an algorithm on a daily basis.
I will add the awesome resources of algorithm regularly.

# Algorithm Of The Day

Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal.
There are three commonly used traversal algorithm:
- Pre-Order Traversal
- In-Order Traversal
- Post-Order Traversal
