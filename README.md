I will add the awesome resources of algorithm regularly.

# Algorithm Of The Day: Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal.
It refers to visiting or updating each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.
There are three commonly used traversal ways in *depth-first order*:
- Pre-Order Traversal
- In-Order Traversal
- Post-Order Traversal
